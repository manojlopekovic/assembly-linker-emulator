# Assembly-linker-emulator

Two-passage assembly implementation, with arm-like structure where all instructions are 4bytes long.

Linker that links and resolves provided files, and link them to .hex file type.

This file type is made up for use on hypothetical system, for which emulator is also written.

Intented usage was for linux, so startup files are configured that way.
